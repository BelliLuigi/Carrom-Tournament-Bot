# CarromBot

### A Telegram bot to keep track of Carrom tournament points


#### What am i doing?

*22/07/2025*: The bot works. I need to add the "go back" button and make it work, add some stats, make it output graphical stats, but the bare structure is done.

*21/07/2025*: I should have done the structure of the _match registration_. Now I have to put up some MySQL database to handle everything.
Update: made work the db: now it saves players and matches. Next thing to do is to show stats.


*20/07/2025*: I decided to change strategy with respect to first iteration of this bot. No more commands just buttons to press.

*16/07/25* : Started working again on this. Did a dockerfile but i think it is a thing that is to be done after the bot code has been written.
