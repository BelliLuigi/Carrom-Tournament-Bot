# CarromBot

### A Telegram bot to keep track of Carrom tournament points


#### What am i doing?

*21/07/2025*: I should have done the structure of the _match registration_. Now I have to put up some MySQL database to handle everything.

*20/07/2025*: I decided to change strategy with respect to first iteration of this bot. No more commands just buttons to press.

*16/07/25* : Started working again on this. Did a dockerfile but i think it is a thing that is to be done after the bot code has been written.
